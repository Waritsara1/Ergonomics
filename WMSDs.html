          <p class="a">
            Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a group of painful disorders of muscles, tendons, and nerves.
            <br>
            Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, thoracic outlet syndrome, and tension neck syndrome are examples.
            <br>
            discuss those injuries resulting from overuse and those that develop over time.
            <br>
            Work activities that are frequent and repetitive, or activities with awkward postures
            <br>
            cause these disorders which may be painful during work or at rest.
            <br>
            Almost all work requires the use of the arms and hands.
            <br>
            Therefore, most WMSD affects the hands, wrists, elbows, neck, and shoulders.
            <br>
            Work using the legs can lead to WMSD of the legs, hips, ankles, and feet.
            <br>
            Some back problems also result from repetitive activities
          </p>

          </div>
          <p class="a">
            WMSDs arise from arm and hand movements such as bending, straightening, gripping, holding, twisting,
            clenching and reaching.
            <br>
            These common movements are not particularly harmful in the ordinary activities of daily life.
            <br>
            What makes them hazardous in work situations is the continual repetition, often in a forceful manner,
            <br>
            and most of all, the speed of the movements and the lack of time for recovery between them.

          <h3><p class="a">How are WMSDs treated?</p></h3>
          <p class="a">The treatment of WMSDs involves several approaches including the following :
            <br>
            1.Restriction of movement
            <br>
            2.Application of heat or cold

          </div>
          <p class="a">
            The first approach to the treatment of WMSDs is to avoid the activities causing the injury.
            <br>
            This often requires work restrictions. In some cases, transfer to a different job should be considered.
            <br>
            A splint can also be used to restrict movements or to immobilize the injured joint.
            <br>
            In the occupational context, splints should not be used as mechanical support for the joint.
            <br>
            Instead, the job should be redesigned to avoid the extreme load on the worker's joint in the first place.
            <br>
            If injurious work continues, then the worker is exposed to the risk of injury
            <br>
            to other joints that have to compensate for the one that is splinted.

            Applying heat or cold seems to relieve pain and may accelerate the repair process.
            <br>
            Cold reduces pain and swelling and is recommended for injuries and inflammation.
            <br>
            Application of ice on painful muscle is recommended only immediately after an injury occurred.
            <br>
            Heat is recommended for muscle pain relief. Heat increases the flow of blood.
            <br>
            It is not recommended for injuries with significant inflammation and swelling.

            Stretching is beneficial because it promotes circulation and reduces muscle tension.
            <br>
            However, people suffering from WMSDs should consult a physical therapist before exercising.
            <br>
            Stretching or exercise programs can aggravate the existing condition if not properly designed.

          1.Workplace Design
          <br>

        <h5><p class="a">Workplace Design</p></h5>
        <p class="a">
          The guiding principle in workplace design is to fit the workplace to the worker.
          <br>
          Evaluation of the workplace can identify the source or sources of WMSD.
          <br>
          Proper design of the workstation decreases the effort required of the worker to maintain a working position.
          <br>
          Ideally, the workstation should be fully adjustable, providing a worker with the options to work in standing,
          <br>
          sitting or sitting-standing positions, as well as fitting the worker's body size and shape.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item-4-2">
        <h5><p class ="a">Tools and Equipment Design</p></h5>
        <p class="a">
          Proper design of tools and equipment significantly decreases the force needed to complete the task.
          <br>
          Providing the worker with the proper jigs or fixtures for tasks that require
          <br>
          holding elements saves a lot of muscular effort in awkward positions.
          <br>
          Good tools, maintained carefully and where necessary frequently changed, can also save a lot of muscle strain.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="item-4-3">
        <h5><p class="a">Work Practices</p></h5>
        <p class="a">
          Training should be provided for workers who are involved in jobs that include repetitive tasks.
          <br>
          Workers need to know how to adjust workstations to fit the tasks and their individual needs.
          <br>
          Training should also emphasize the importance of rest periods and teach
          <br>
          how to take advantage of short periods of time between tasks to relax the muscles,
          <br>
          and how to consciously control muscle tension throughout the whole work shift.
